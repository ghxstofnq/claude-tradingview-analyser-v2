description: Phase-aware ICT analysis. Runs Lanto's 3-pillar strategy end-to-end across a trading session, building session memory in state/session/<date>/<session>/. Designed to be invoked once per bar close.
---

<strategy_authority>

This project implements Lanto's 3-pillar ICT framework. The authoritative spec:

- [docs/strategy/trading-strategy-2026.md](../../docs/strategy/trading-strategy-2026.md) — three pillars, 7-step checklist, A+/B grading.
- [docs/strategy/entry-models.md](../../docs/strategy/entry-models.md) — MSS / Trend / Inversion components, A+ examples.

Strategy §7 is sequential: HTF bias → overnight → Pillar 2 → NY reaction → entry model → confirmation → sizing. This command walks that sequence across a whole session by branching on phase.

Architecture plan: [docs/plans/llm-driven-session.md](../../docs/plans/llm-driven-session.md). Data source: [docs/plans/2026-05-21-ict-engine-migration.md](../../docs/plans/2026-05-21-ict-engine-migration.md).

</strategy_authority>

<how_to_run>

Use one of two capture commands, then `Read state/last-analyze.json`. The bundle is the single data source for this invocation; the dashboard reads it too.

**Full capture** — run when (a) it is the first invocation of the session, (b) `state/baseline.json` does not exist, (c) the triggering detector event has `is_5m_close: true`, or (d) `baseline_meta.age_seconds > 900` in the last bundle. Multi-TF sweep (~13s); refreshes the HTF baseline:

```bash
./bin/tv analyze --out state/last-analyze.json && cp state/last-analyze.json state/baseline.json
```

**Fast capture** — every other 1m close. Reuses the cached HTF baseline; returns in ~0.2s:

```bash
./bin/tv analyze --pillar3-only --baseline state/baseline.json --out state/last-analyze.json
```

A fast capture still carries fresh current-TF data plus `bars_by_tf`, `engine_by_tf`, and `gates.engine.pillar2.m5/m15` merged from the baseline. Pre-session always uses a full capture — HTF bias needs the live sweep.

After reading, look at `gates.session.phase` to determine what to do.

</how_to_run>

<bundle_fields>

The ICT Engine indicator is the single data source. It emits one schema-versioned evidence table; `tv analyze` parses it into structured numeric objects. Every price resolves at a real JSON path.

- `chart` — symbol, current resolution, indicators on chart.
- `quote.last` — current price.
- `bars` — OHLCV summary + `last_5_bars` at the current chart TF.
- `bars_by_tf.{daily, h4, h1, m15, m5, m1}` — per-TF bar summaries incl. `range` and `change_pct` (use these for HTF momentum).
- `engine` — the parsed ICT Engine table at the chart's current TF: `{schema, schema_supported, meta, levels[], sweeps[], fvgs[], bprs[], swings[], structures[], pools[], quality}`.
- `engine_by_tf.{daily, h4, h1, m15, m5, m1}` — the same parsed engine object captured at each TF. HTF FVGs and HTF structure live here (`.fvgs`, `.structures`, `.swings`, `.quality`, `.levels`).
- `pair` (present only when `tv analyze --pair` was used) — dual-symbol scan: `{primary, secondary, window_start_ms, window_end_ms, symbols, leader_evidence, leader_decided, leader}`. `pair.symbols.<symbol>` carries the same shape as the top-level bundle for each symbol. `pair.leader_evidence` is computed in code (`{primary_disp_score, secondary_disp_score, margin, threshold, reason, primary_fvg_path, secondary_fvg_path}`); cite it verbatim. `pair.leader` is `null` until `surface_leader_decision` fires; the chosen symbol thereafter.
- `pair_short_circuited` (present only when the analyzer detected an existing pair-decision.json for the active session) — `true` means the bundle is single-symbol on the leader; no `pair` block this turn.
- `gates.session.*` — clock-based facts (phase, label, minutes_into_phase, next_killzone_label, seconds_to_next_killzone, in_killzone, is_market_closed, replay state).
- `gates.engine.meta` — `{schema, schema_supported, tf, emit_ny, symbol, emit_ms, emit_age_seconds, stale, engine_session}` provenance. **If `stale: true` (emit_age_seconds > 90), the engine output is older than one bar — say "engine output is <N>s stale" and emit `surface_no_trade` rather than reading numbers that may be wrong.** `engine_session` is Pine's DST-aware classification (`asia|london|ny_am|ny_pm|off`) — flag any drift vs `gates.session.phase`.
- `gates.engine.price_context.{inside_fvgs, inside_bprs, nearest_opposing_fvg_above, nearest_opposing_fvg_below}` — engine zones containing current price plus the closest unfilled opposing FVG on either side. Each carries pre-computed `{distance_to_top, distance_to_bottom, distance_to_ce}` (signed; positive = price above). Cite the pre-computed distances directly.
- `gates.engine.pillar1.session_levels.{PWH, PWL, PDH, PDL, AS_H, AS_L, LO_H, LO_L, NYAM_H, NYAM_L}` — each `{name, price, state, swept, formed_ms, position_vs_price}`. `untaken_sell_side_below[]` + `untaken_buy_side_above[]` are pre-sorted draw targets. `sweeps[]` — explicit liquidity-raid events `{target, price, side, swept_ms, rejected}` (`rejected: true` = a failure-swing reversal tell).
- `gates.engine.pillar1.{liquidity_pools, untaken_pools_above, untaken_pools_below}` — equal-high (`kind=eqh`) / equal-low (`kind=eql`) pools the engine maintains (strategy §2.1 draw-target liquidity). Sorted closest-first. Each pool `{kind, side, price, swept}`.
- `gates.engine.pillar2.{current_tf, m5, m15}` — engine quality verdict per TF: `{range_3h, range_quality (good|tight|na), displacement (clean|acceptable|weak|na), candle (engulfing|doji_wick|normal), atr_14, atr_17, session}`. `acceptable` displacement is workable but weaker than `clean`. ATRs are Wilder values shipped by Pine.
- `gates.engine.pillar3.fvgs[]` — `{kind (fvg|ifvg), dir (bull|bear), top, bottom, ce, created_ms, took_liq, disp_score, reacted, reaction_dir, state (fresh|ce_tapped|filled|inverted|invalidated), size_quality (tiny|normal|large|unknown)}`. Use the engine's `size_quality` field for FVG size decisions: skip `tiny` zones as setup FVGs; `normal` and `large` are tradable. `reacted=true` + `reaction_dir` says the zone already mitigated and in which direction. Pine keeps the most-recent 24 per TF (FIFO).
- `gates.engine.pillar3.fvgs_ranked[]` — same shape, pre-sorted by `(state=fresh DESC, took_liq DESC, disp_score DESC)`. Prefer this when picking a setup FVG; `fvgs_ranked[0]` is the highest-priority candidate. `fvgs[]` stays Pine order for raw inspection.
- `gates.engine.pillar3.{bprs[], swings:{internal[], swing[]}, structure_events[], structures_by_tier:{swing[], internal[]}, failure_swings[], most_recent_structure, fvg_summary}` — each swing `{kind, price, bar_ms, tier, swept, is_high}`; each `structure_events` entry `{event (bos|mss), dir, level, displacement, tier, validation (break|sweep), confirmed_ms, is_reclaimed}`. Prefer `structures_by_tier.swing[]` for Trend/MSS reads on external pivots. `failure_swings[]` is the pre-filtered pool of `event=mss + validation=sweep` — stop-run reversals, the strongest reversal cue in the engine. `most_recent_structure` is the latest by `confirmed_ms`. **`is_reclaimed`** is computed from `quote.last` vs `level` by `dir`: a bullish BoS at 29804.75 is `is_reclaimed: true` when `quote.last < 29804.75` (the breakout failed back into the prior range). Same logic for MSS. Treat a reclaimed bos/mss as invalidating the continuation read — don't cite it as a bullish/bearish continuation cue when reclaimed.
- `gates.engine.confirmation.{last_bar, last_bar_age_seconds, m5_last_bar, m15_last_bar}` — single-bar confirmation facts `{time, open, high, low, close, body_ratio, direction, range, close_position_in_range}`.

</bundle_fields>

<rules>

Eight non-negotiable rules (research-backed; sources in `docs/research/*.md`):

1. **Cite or omit.** Every price must appear in the bundle and be cited `<price> (<json.path>)`. The path must resolve to the cited value. Examples: `29172.75 (quote.last)`, `29397 (gates.engine.pillar1.session_levels.PDH.price)`, `29326 (gates.engine.pillar3.fvgs[0].ce)`, `7393.5 (engine_by_tf.h4.fvgs[0].bottom)`. Prose-style parens like `(close)` are not citations. The verifier (`npm run smoke:fixtures`) enforces this mechanically.
2. **No arithmetic.** Stop distance, R:R, ATR, bar counts, range size, displacement magnitude — all live in the bundle. If the JSON doesn't have it, write `n/a — needs upstream computation`.
3. **If `gates.engine` is `null`** the ICT Engine is not on the chart — say so and stop. If `gates.engine.pillar3.fvgs` is empty, write "no FVGs from the engine." If a section's data isn't in the JSON, write `n/a`.
4. **Prose first, JSON last.** Any structured block goes at the end of the chat response. Mid-reasoning JSON degrades accuracy.
5. **Grade enum only.** Use `A+`, `B`, or `no-trade`. No "high-conviction" / "very likely" / "actionable" / "strong setup".
6. **Match entry-model components literally.** Walk them in order, by name. Do not paraphrase.
7. **Time awareness comes from the bundle.** `gates.session.phase`, `minutes_into_phase`, `seconds_to_next_killzone`, `day_of_week` — these are pre-computed. No clock math.
8. **`chain_status` emission.** Every surface tool call (`surface_session_brief`, `surface_ltf_bias`, `surface_leader_decision`) sets `chain_status`. Enum values:
   - `clean` — all inputs read, all outputs structured
   - `degraded:<reason>` — output produced with a caveat (e.g. `degraded:leader_inconclusive`, `degraded:brief_no_trade_soft`)
   - `backfilled:<phase>` — synthesized after the fact (catch_up only)
   - `divergent` — open_reaction found HTF/LTF clash
   - `stale:<minutes>` — upstream output older than N min vs the bar this phase fired on
   Wrap reads these from each frontmatter to build the chain_audit block in `summary.md`.

Project constraints in `CLAUDE.md` always apply.

</rules>

<phase_routing>

Read `gates.session.phase`. Branch:

| Phase value | What to do |
|---|---|
| `pre_session_ny_am`, `pre_session_ny_pm` | Pre-session prep runs as a **brief turn** — see `<phase name="brief">`. |
| `open_reaction_ny_am`, `open_reaction_ny_pm` | Open-reaction watch (15-min window). |
| `entry_hunt_ny_am`, `entry_hunt_ny_pm` | Per-bar entry-model hunt. |
| `post_ny_am`, `post_ny_pm` | Session wrap. |
| `catch_up_ny_am`, `catch_up_ny_pm` | Backfill `ltf-bias.md` + `pair-decision.json` after a missed open-reaction window. Grade always capped at B. See `<phase name="catch_up">`. |
| `london_open` | (Optional) one-shot grade via the **brief** workflow (`<phase name="brief">`), London context. |
| `inter_session`, `closed` | Idle; emit a one-line status, no state writes. |

**Brief turns** (fired from `session-brief.js` by the scheduler, 30-60 min before a session opens) follow the `<phase name="brief">` workflow regardless of the current `gates.session.phase`. The user message will say "This is a SESSION BRIEF turn for the <SESSION> session." — when you see that, do the brief phase end-to-end.

Files live in a per-session folder, `state/session/<date>/<session>/`:

- `<date>` — derived from `gates.session.timestamp_et` (e.g. "Tue, 05/19/2026, 14:30:00" → `2026-05-19`).
- `<session>` — derived from the phase: any `*_ny_am` phase → `ny-am`; any `*_ny_pm` → `ny-pm`; `london_open` → `london`.
- `<sdir>` is the shorthand used throughout this command for that full path: `<sdir>/pillar1.md` means `state/session/<date>/<session>/pillar1.md`. Create `<sdir>` on demand before the first write.

Each session folder is self-contained — NY AM, NY PM, and London never overwrite each other. The one day-level file is the detector's `bar-close-events.jsonl`, which stays directly under `state/session/<date>/`.

</phase_routing>

<phase name="brief">

**Goal:** publish the PREP-panel SESSION BRIEF for one or both symbols. Fires once per session, 30-60 min before the session opens. The trader reads this live during the open; tight, cited, consistent.

**What this phase produces:** one (or two, for `--pair`) call to `surface_session_brief` per symbol. `writeBrief` re-renders `pillar1.md` / `pillar2.md` automatically from the surface payload's structured fields.

### Required action

1. **Capture.** Call `mcp__tv__tv_analyze_full` with the pair param from the user message (`pair="MNQ1!,MES1!"` in dual-symbol mode). It writes TWO files: `state/last-analyze.json` (full bundle, ~440KB compact) and **`state/last-analyze.digest.json`** (pretty-printed digest, ~17KB).

2. **Read `state/last-analyze.digest.json` — NOT the full bundle.** The digest is the brief turn's data source. It is pretty-printed (one field per line, ~500 lines) so the Read tool returns it intact. The full bundle is one giant single-line JSON whose per-line content gets truncated at ~2000 chars by Read; do not try to read it for the brief. Cite as `brief_digest.symbols.<sym>.*` even though the file's actual content is the digest at the top level — the prompt convention uses `brief_digest.` as a citation prefix so downstream phases can find the same path through the in-memory bundle.

3. **For each symbol** in the digest's `symbols` map (loop over both for `--pair`), walk the steps below. Cite from `brief_digest.symbols.<sym>.*`.

### Step 1 — HTF Bias (Daily / 4H / 1H)

Walk each TF by name. Pull engine-backed signals **at that TF**:

- `brief_digest.symbols.<sym>.htf.<tf>.change_pct` — momentum sign for that TF.
- `brief_digest.symbols.<sym>.htf.<tf>.top_fvgs[0..2]` — best PD arrays at that TF (ranked by state=fresh, took_liq, disp_score). Includes iFVGs (kind=`ifvg`).
- `brief_digest.symbols.<sym>.htf.<tf>.top_bprs[0..2]` — BPRs at that TF.
- `brief_digest.symbols.<sym>.htf.<tf>.recent_structures[0..1]` — most recent `event` (`bos`/`mss`) with `dir` + `is_reclaimed`.

For each TF emit one `htf_bias` row `{tf, bias, note}`:
- `bias`: `BULLISH | BEARISH | MIXED | NEUTRAL`. `MIXED` = momentum and structure disagree. `NEUTRAL` = both signals flat / absent.
- `note`: one short sentence that **cites at least one path under `brief_digest.symbols.<sym>.htf.<tf>`** for the row's exact TF. Wrong-TF citations (e.g. `engine.structures[*]` in a 4H row) are bugs — `engine.*` is current chart TF (usually 1m).

If `brief_digest.symbols.<sym>.htf.<tf>` is empty for a TF (no FVGs, no structures), say `bias: NEUTRAL` and the note cites the absence: `"top_fvgs and recent_structures both empty"`. Never invent a directional bias without a per-TF citation.

### Step 2 — Pick the Primary HTF PD Array

From `brief_digest.symbols.<sym>.htf.{daily,h4,h1}.top_fvgs` + `top_bprs`, pick ONE with:
- highest `disp_score × took_liq` (extensive AND took liquidity in creation)
- AND state ∈ `{fresh, ce_tapped, inverted}` (not filled/invalidated)

This is the **primary draw** — anchor for everything downstream (open_reaction, entry_hunt, wrap). Strategy §2.1: "He prefers 4H PD arrays when possible because they tend to be cleaner and more tradable intraday." Default to h4 when h4 and h1 are tied.

Surface as `primary_draw` in the tool call:

```
primary_draw: {
  tf:         "h4",       // or "daily" | "h1"
  kind:       "fvg",      // or "bpr" | "ifvg"
  dir:        "bull",     // or "bear"
  top, bottom, ce: <numbers from the chosen entry>,
  disp_score: <number>,
  took_liq:   true,
  state:      "fresh",
  cite:       "engine_by_tf.h4.fvgs[2]"   // must match /engine_by_tf\.(daily|h4|h1)\.(fvgs|bprs)/
}
htf_destination: "above 30000 buy-side"   // or "below 29400 sell-side" / "balanced"
```

### Step 3 — Overnight & Session Correlation

Read `brief_digest.symbols.<sym>.pillar1.*`. Walk session levels: PWH, PWL, PDH, PDL, AS_H, AS_L, LO_H, LO_L, NYAM_H, NYAM_L. For each: cite state (taken/untaken) from `pillar1.session_levels.<name>.state`.

Walk `pillar1.sweeps[]`. Sweeps with `rejected: true` are failure-swing reversals — surface them; they're the strongest cue.

Walk `pillar1.untaken_pools_above[0..2]` + `untaken_pools_below[0..2]` — equal-H/L liquidity (strategy §2.1 draw-target liquidity).

Surface as `overnight_block` in the tool call:

```
overnight_block: {
  asia:   { high, low, state: "extended"|"swept"|"untaken", cite },
  london: { high, low, state, cite },
  untaken_above: [{name, price, cite}, ...],
  untaken_below: [{name, price, cite}, ...],
  overnight_verdict: "extending_htf" | "retracing_htf" | "consolidating",
  path_to_destination: "clear" | "capped_by_<level>" | "contradicted_by_<level>"
}
```

`path_to_destination`: between current price and `primary_draw`, what's in the way? "clear" = no untaken HTF level blocking; "capped_by_<name>" = a level must break first; "contradicted_by_<name>" = a level reached above/below the draw would flip the read.

### Step 4 — Pillar 2 Quality

Read both LTF and HTF quality:

- LTF: `brief_digest.symbols.<sym>.pillar2.{current_tf, m5, m15}`
- HTF: `brief_digest.symbols.<sym>.htf.h4.quality` + `brief_digest.symbols.<sym>.htf.h1.quality`

Strategy §3 / §7 step 3: "4H/1H candles show real displacement and decent-sized PD arrays" — HTF quality is required, not optional.

Surface as `htf_quality` + `pillar2_verdict`:

```
htf_quality: {
  h4: { range_quality, displacement, candle, cite: "engine_by_tf.h4.quality" },
  h1: { range_quality, displacement, candle, cite: "engine_by_tf.h1.quality" }
}
pillar2_verdict: "good" | "marginal" | "poor"
```

### Step 5 — Deterministic Grade (Pillars 1 + 2, brief scope)

| Grade | Rule |
|---|---|
| `A+` | HTF agrees across ≥2 of D/4H/1H **with cited evidence** AND ≥1 untaken HTF draw remains AND Pillar 2 `range_quality=good` + `displacement∈{clean,acceptable}` + `candle≠doji_wick`. |
| `B` | Pillars 1+2 align with **EXACTLY ONE** weaker element. |
| `no-trade` | **≥2 weak/missing elements**, OR any HTF TF NEUTRAL because the data wasn't read, OR `gates.engine.meta.stale: true`. **Must set `no_trade_reason`.** |

`no_trade_reason` enum (required when grade=`no-trade`):
- `data_gap` — bundle missing fields that should be present
- `engine_stale` — `gates.engine.meta.stale: true`
- `pillar2_poor` — chop / low quality (soft short-circuit — open_reaction can still recover)
- `htf_unclear` — HTF TFs all NEUTRAL or contradictory (soft)
- `session_closed` — market closed / non-trading day

If you cannot cite a TF, that TF counts as missing — escalate toward `no-trade`. Do not paper-over a data gap with a `B`.

### Step 6 — Scenarios

Build 2 to 4 scenarios. Each is the if/then plan for a specific entry trigger. Five required fields per scenario:

- `id`: stable short id — `"scn-1"`, `"scn-2"`.
- `grade`: per-scenario grade (`"A+"`, `"B"`, or `"no-trade"`). A+ when all six elements would align if the trigger fires; B if exactly one is weaker; no-trade for defensive scenarios where you'd stand aside. **This is independent of `pillar_grade`** — the overall pre-session grade above. A `pillar_grade=B` brief can still carry an A+ scenario (the A+ requires the trigger to fire AND Pillar 3 to confirm).
- `condition`: trigger condition with cited prices — `"NY opens above 21487.25 (PDH) and holds for 1 closed bar"`. UI labels this row "TRIGGER".
- `action`: reaction / bias — `"long continuation toward 21528.50 (PWH); stop below 21450.50 (AS_L)"`.
- `target`: anchored target with citation — `"21 528.50 (PWH)"` or `"21 420 (engine_by_tf.h4.fvgs[0].top)"`. Must contain a digit; Zod refines on this.

Cite from `brief_digest.symbols.<sym>.ltf_context.*` or `pillar1.session_levels.*`. Never invent a level not in the bundle.

**A+ example:**
```json
{
  "id": "scn-1",
  "grade": "A+",
  "condition": "sweep of AS.L at 21 290 (pillar1.session_levels.AS_L) + 5m MSS up + tap of 4H FVG 21 300-21 320 (engine_by_tf.h4.fvgs[0])",
  "action": "MSS long on the 5m FVG retest, stop below the sweep wick",
  "target": "21 420 (pillar1.session_levels.PWH)"
}
```

### Step 7 — Sizing Note

Use the strategy sizing table + memory.USER overrides. Format: `"0.75 R · Tue standard (strategy.sizing-table)"` or `"0.5 R · A+ but Mon-reduced (strategy.sizing-table, memory.USER)"`. Cite must contain `(strategy...)` OR `(memory.USER)` OR `(memory.MEMORY)`.

### Step 8 — Self-check before surface_session_brief

- Each `htf_bias` row's `note` cites at least one path **at that TF** (`brief_digest.symbols.<sym>.htf.<tf>` or sub-paths). Wrong-TF cites are bugs.
- `primary_draw.cite` matches `/engine_by_tf\.(daily|h4|h1)\.(fvgs|bprs)/`.
- Every numeric price in `brief`, scenarios, `anchored_target`, `anchored_stop` is followed by `(json.path)`.
- No arithmetic in prose. Ranges/deltas come from `brief_digest.*.range` or you write `n/a`.
- `pillar_grade` matches the rule in Step 5.
- `key_levels[].name` uses canonical engine names (no parenthetical state suffixes).
- If `pillar_grade=no-trade`, `no_trade_reason` is set.
- The brief doesn't contradict itself — no "counter-HTF" scenarios when HTF wasn't captured.
- `chain_status: clean` unless something was degraded; in which case use the appropriate `degraded:<reason>` form.

If any check fails, fix the payload, then call `surface_session_brief`.

### Tool call

End the turn with one `surface_session_brief` call per symbol — twice in `--pair` mode (once with `symbol="MNQ1!"`, once with `symbol="MES1!"`). Skip `surface_setup` / `surface_no_trade` in brief turns.

</phase>

<phase name="open_reaction">

**Goal:** first 15 min of NY's reaction to overnight levels (09:30-09:45 ET / 13:30-13:45 ET). Read the brief's structured handoff, watch live engine, decide leader + LTF bias at **minute 14** (09:44 ET NY AM / 13:44 ET NY PM).

### Required reads first

- `<sdir>/pillar1.md` frontmatter → both symbols' `mnq:`/`mes:` sections with `primary_draw`, `htf_destination`, `path_to_destination`, `pillar_grade`, `no_trade_reason`. If `pillar1.md` doesn't exist, that's a prereq error — say so and stop.
- `<sdir>/pillar2.md` frontmatter → `pillar2_verdict` per symbol.
- `<sdir>/open-reaction.md` if it exists (we're appending).

### Step 0 — Brief = no-trade gate (do this FIRST)

Branch on `pillar_grade` from pillar1.md:

| Grade | `no_trade_reason` | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `A+` / `B` | n/a | Normal flow below |
| `no-trade` | `data_gap` / `engine_stale` / `session_closed` | **Hard skip.** Write `open-reaction.md` with `chain_status: degraded:brief_no_trade_hard`. No `ltf-bias.md` write, no `surface_leader_decision`. Surface `surface_no_trade("brief no-trade: <reason>")`. Stop. |
| `no-trade` | `pillar2_poor` / `htf_unclear` | **Soft observe.** Continue to the leader decision. At minute 14 write `ltf-bias.md` with `ltf_bias: stand_aside`, `chain_status: degraded:brief_no_trade_soft`. The model may flag in chat if conditions clearly recover (doji_wick → engulfing + clean displacement). |

### Minutes 0-13 — per-bar observation

Read `gates.engine.confirmation.last_bar`, `gates.engine.pillar1.sweeps`, `gates.engine.most_recent_structure`, `pair.leader_evidence`.

Append to `<sdir>/open-reaction.md`:

```markdown
## Latest read (<timestamp>, +<minutes_into_phase>m)
MNQ disp_score=<n> (pair.leader_evidence.primary_disp_score) vs MES <n> (pair.leader_evidence.secondary_disp_score), margin=<n>, threshold=<n>.
What each symbol did vs path_to_destination: <one sentence cited>.
```

### Minute 14 — DECISION (two parallel writes)

#### A) Leader decision

Read `pair.leader_evidence` once more. Resolve leader:

| `reason` | Leader | `chain_status` for pair-decision.json |
|---|---|---|
| `primary_higher_disp_score` (margin ≥ threshold) | primary | `clean` |
| `secondary_higher_disp_score` (margin ≥ threshold) | secondary | `clean` |
| `inconclusive_margin_below_threshold` | **primary (default)** | `degraded:leader_inconclusive` |
| `no_fvgs_created_in_window` | **primary (default)** | `degraded:no_fvgs_in_window` |
| `secondary_engine_missing` | primary | `degraded:secondary_missing` |

Call `surface_leader_decision` with the chosen leader + evidence + reason verbatim from `pair.leader_evidence`.

#### B) LTF bias finalization

Computed on the chosen leader, using its `pillar1.<leader>` section + live engine.

Compute `entry_model_priority` from this decision tree:

```
if pillar2_verdict == "poor":            → "undecided"
elif htf_ltf_alignment == "divergent":   → "MSS" (LTF reversal at HTF level)
elif htf_ltf_alignment == "aligned":
   if recent failure_swings (mss+sweep): → "MSS"   (cite: failure_swings[0])
   elif recent BoS in bias direction:    → "Trend" (cite: most_recent_structure)
   elif opposing FVG state=inverted:     → "Inversion" (cite: fvgs[where state=inverted])
   else:                                 → "undecided"
elif htf_ltf_alignment == "unclear":     → "undecided"
```

`surface_ltf_bias` runtime cross-checks this against `cli/lib/entry-model-priority.js`. Mismatches log a warning; the model's choice wins (but `undecided` is always honored).

Call `surface_ltf_bias` with:

### Divergence handling (HTF/LTF clash)

If `htf_ltf_alignment: divergent`:
- `ltf_bias` follows NY reaction direction
- `is_retrace_day: true`
- `grade_cap: B` (entry_hunt cannot surface A+ this session)
- `pillar1.<leader>.primary_draw` stays valid as **end-of-day runner target** — not invalidated
- `chain_status: divergent`

### Self-check before tool calls

- Leader decision uses verbatim `pair.leader_evidence.reason`.
- `entry_model_priority` matches the decision tree.
- `grade_cap` is `B` if and only if `htf_ltf_alignment == divergent`.
- Backfill case (caught up after window) → `chain_status: backfilled:open_reaction` + `grade_cap: B` (see `<phase name="catch_up">`).

If any check fails, fix the payload, then call `surface_leader_decision` + `surface_ltf_bias`.

</phase>

<phase name="entry_hunt">

You are in entry hunt. A precomputed `<candidate_object>` block has been injected above. The detector has already evaluated every entry-model rule against engine state. **Your job is to package and narrate, not to interpret strategy.**

## Procedure

1. Read `<candidate_object>`.
2. If `best_candidate` is non-null:
   - Call `surface_setup` with EXACTLY these values from best_candidate:
     - `model` = best_candidate.model
     - `side` = best_candidate.side
     - `entry` = best_candidate.entry.value, `entry_cite` = best_candidate.entry.cite
     - `stop` = best_candidate.stop.value (must be one of best_candidate.stop_options), `stop_cite` = best_candidate.stop.cite
     - `tp1` = best_candidate.tp1.value, `tp1_cite` = best_candidate.tp1.cite
     - `tp2` = best_candidate.tp2.value, `tp2_cite` = best_candidate.tp2.cite
     - `grade` = best_candidate.grade_capped (NOT grade_proposed; the cap is enforced)
   - Write 2-3 sentences for the `narration` field explaining the chain (what set it up, what triggered, what's at risk, what closes the chain).
3. If `best_candidate` is null:
   - Call `surface_no_trade` with `reason` = candidate.rejection_summary (verbatim).
   - Add a 1-sentence `note` describing what to watch on the next bar.

## You may NOT

- Override the detector's pick or surface a setup it didn't find. If you disagree, call `surface_no_trade` and set `chain_status: degraded:disagreement` with a 1-sentence reason in `note`. The detector's decision stands; you cannot trade.
- Promote `grade` past `grade_capped`. The validator rejects this.
- Substitute a different stop value than one of `stop_options[]`. Pick `stop_options[0]` unless its cite fails to resolve, then `stop_options[1]`.
- Substitute a TP that isn't from `untaken_above[]` / `untaken_below[]`. Detector already filtered; use its picks.
- Walk strategy from scratch. The detector has done that work. Trust the components.

See `<anti_patterns>` block below for the 8 specific misreads from the 2026-05-26 session you must avoid.

### Append-only bookkeeping

After the surface_setup or surface_no_trade call, append to `<sdir>/bars.jsonl`:

```jsonl
{"time": <bar_time>, "tf": "1m", "o": <open>, "h": <high>, "l": <low>, "c": <close>, "body_ratio": <bratio>, "direction": "<dir>", "close_position_in_range": <cp>}
```

(Use `gates.engine.confirmation.last_bar.*`. Write `tf: "5m"` to `bars-5m.jsonl` on 5m boundaries.)

If a setup fired, also append to `<sdir>/setups.jsonl`:

```jsonl
{"ts": "<iso>", "bar_time": <t>, "tf": "1m", "model": "<best_candidate.model>", "status": "confirmed", "side": "<best_candidate.side>", "rationale": "<narration verbatim>"}
```

</phase>

<anti_patterns>

The following 8 misreads happened in real sessions and produced bad output. The detector now prevents most of them structurally, but if you ever find yourself doing one of these, stop and re-read `<candidate_object>`.

**❌ "FRESH FVG" DOES NOT MEAN "RETESTED".**
   `engine.fvgs[N].state: "fresh"` + `created_ms` in the last 1-3 bars means the pullback has not happened yet. The 3 candles around `created_ms` CREATED the FVG, they did not retest it. The detector's `retrace_to_fvg.present` checks `price_context.inside_fvgs[]` — trust that.

**❌ "REACTED" DOES NOT MEAN "RETESTED".**
   `reacted: true` (now exposed as `displacement_at_creation: true` after disambiguation) = the impulse that CREATED the FVG was clean. It does NOT mean a later pullback tested the zone.

**❌ SWEPT LEVELS ARE NOT VALID TARGETS.**
   `gates.engine.pillar1.session_levels.<LEVEL>.swept: true` (or `taken: true`) means the level was already taken. NEVER cite as TP. The detector's `tp1` / `tp2` pull from `untaken_above[]` / `untaken_below[]` only.

**❌ FVG-BOTTOM STOP IS A LAST-RESORT FALLBACK.**
   Strategy priority for FVG entries: candle 1 low of the 3-candle FVG formation > pullback swing low > FVG bottom. The detector pre-ranks all three in `stop_options[]`. Pick `stop_options[0]` unless its cite fails to resolve.

**❌ LOCKED LTF BIAS DOES NOT FORCE DIRECTION.**
   `ltf_bias.bias` is a snapshot at the leader-decision moment, not a lock for the entire session. The detector's `side` is computed from HTF destination + current engine state — trust its side pick over a stale LTF bias.

**❌ PHASE TAG IS DERIVED FROM ET CLOCK, NOT WRITTEN BY MODEL.**
   Do not author `"phase: open_reaction_ny_pm"` at 13:09 ET (21 min before NY PM open at 13:30). The phase is set by `surface.js` based on the live ET clock.

**❌ SIZING IS PRE-COMPUTED, NEVER FABRICATED.**
   `sizing_note` must come from the `<sizing_pre_computed>` block in the brief prompt, citing `memory.USER` or `strategy.sizing-table`. Do not write a prose-level sizing claim like "Tuesday standard."

**❌ NEVER PROMOTE GRADE PAST `grade_capped`.**
   If detector emits `grade_capped: B`, surfacing `grade: A+` will be rejected by the validator. Use `grade_capped` directly.

</anti_patterns>

<phase name="catch_up">

**Goal:** synthesize a missed `open_reaction` after the window has passed (NY open ≥ 09:45 ET / 13:45 ET) but `ltf-bias.md` doesn't exist. Best-effort backfill so `entry_hunt` has the chain anchors it needs.

**Triggered by:** the bar-close router when (a) `ltf-bias.md` is missing, (b) `pillar1.md` exists, (c) current ET time is past the open-reaction window for the active session. See `app/main/bar-close.js` `shouldRouteToCatchUp`.

**Required reads:**
- `<sdir>/pillar1.md` frontmatter → both symbols' `primary_draw` + `pillar_grade`.
- Live bundle including `pair.leader_evidence` (if `pair` present).

### Behavior

1. Run the leader decision + LTF bias synthesis exactly like `<phase name="open_reaction">` Minute 14, but on data that has drifted past the actual open.

2. Compute `backfill_lag_minutes` = (now ET) − (window start). Window starts at 09:30 ET (NY AM) / 13:30 ET (NY PM).

3. Write `ltf-bias.md` with the structured handoff:

```yaml
---
phase: open_reaction_<session>_complete
finalized_at: <now>
backfilled: true
backfill_lag_minutes: <int>
leader: <chosen>
ltf_bias: <bullish|bearish|mixed|stand_aside>
htf_ltf_alignment: <aligned|divergent|unclear>
is_retrace_day: <bool>
entry_model_priority: <MSS|Trend|Inversion|undecided>
priority_reason: <one-line>
grade_cap: B                  # catch-up ALWAYS caps at B (we didn't see the actual open)
chain_status: backfilled:open_reaction
---
```

4. Also call `surface_leader_decision` so `pair-decision.json` lands. Subsequent `tv analyze --pair` runs short-circuit to single-symbol.

5. Chat output flags the backfill explicitly: *"Backfilled open-reaction at &lt;ET&gt; (&lt;lag&gt;min late). Grade capped at B for this session."*

After this fires, subsequent bars route to `<phase name="entry_hunt">` normally.

### Self-check

- `grade_cap: B` is mandatory (no A+ in backfilled sessions).
- `backfilled: true` and `backfill_lag_minutes` set.
- `chain_status: backfilled:open_reaction`.
- Both `surface_leader_decision` AND `surface_ltf_bias` fired in this turn.

</phase>

<phase name="post_session">

**Goal:** write a one-paragraph wrap to this session's folder, then idle.

**The work:**

- If `<sdir>/summary.md` already exists, this session is wrapped — output "Already wrapped." and stop.
- Otherwise read `<sdir>/pillar1.md`, `<sdir>/pillar2.md`, `<sdir>/ltf-bias.md`, `<sdir>/setups.jsonl`, then `Write` `<sdir>/summary.md`:

```markdown
---
session: ny-am          # ny-am | ny-pm | london
date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
wrapped_at: <gates.session.timestamp_et>
---

# Session Summary — <session>, <YYYY-MM-DD>

## Bias picture
<one paragraph synthesizing P1 + P2 + LTF bias, prices cited>

## What happened
<one paragraph: did setups fire / confirm; the session's narrative>

## Watch next session
<one or two bullets>
```

Each session writes its own `summary.md` inside its own folder, so the NY AM, NY PM, and London wraps all persist independently for later review — nothing is overwritten.

### Chat output

The single-paragraph wrap. Then say what's next ("Idle until NY PM at 13:00 ET" / "Idle until tomorrow's London Open").

### Self-check before chat output

- `<sdir>/summary.md` exists with `bias_picture`, `what_happened`, `watch_next_session` filled.
- Bias picture cites at least two prices from `<sdir>/pillar1.md` or `<sdir>/pillar2.md`.
- What-happened references any setup that fired (from `<sdir>/setups.jsonl`) by its model + status, or explicitly states "no setups fired".

If any check fails, rewrite the section, then emit chat output.

</phase>

<phase name="other">

**London Open** — optional context-build window. The system is session-focused (NY AM + NY PM), but if you want a London read, treat it as a one-shot grade. Here `<session>` is `london`, so `<sdir>` resolves to `state/session/<date>/london/`. Write `<sdir>/pillar1.md` and `<sdir>/pillar2.md` exactly as in the Pre-session phase (`phase: london_open` in the frontmatter), then a brief `<sdir>/summary.md` wrap as in the Post-session phase. The `london/` folder is independent — NY AM and NY PM never touch it, so the London grade persists for later review. Skip the grade if `<sdir>/pillar1.md` already exists.

**Inter-session, Closed** — idle. Say "Outside NY sessions — no work" plus current phase + countdown. No state writes.

</phase>

<ict_vocabulary>

- **Market-structure labels (HH/HL/LH/LL)** — the ICT Engine names a swing pivot with the textbook convention: the SECOND letter is the pivot type (`H`igh or `L`ow), the FIRST is whether it is `H`igher or `L`ower than the previous pivot of that same type.
  - `HH` = Higher High — a swing **high** above the prior high
  - `HL` = Higher Low — a swing **low** above the prior low
  - `LH` = Lower High — a swing **high** below the prior high
  - `LL` = Lower Low — a swing **low** below the prior low
  - `HH` and `LH` are swing **highs**; `HL` and `LL` are swing **lows**. Each engine swing also carries an explicit `is_high` boolean — trust it. An uptrend prints `HH` + `HL`; a downtrend prints `LH` + `LL`.
- **HTF / LTF** — higher TF (Daily / 4H / 1H) sets bias; LTF (15m / 5m / 1m) triggers.
- **Liquidity** — stop pools above swing highs (buy-side) or below swing lows (sell-side).
- **PDH / PDL** — previous day's high / low.
- **FVG** — 3-bar imbalance. The engine emits each with `top` / `bottom` / `ce` / `state`; acts as a retracement target.
- **BPR** — Balanced Price Range. Overlapping bullish + bearish FVGs; the engine emits these as `bprs[]`.
- **Order block** — last opposing candle before strong displacement.
- **Mitigation** — price returning to an FVG / OB. The engine tracks it as FVG `state`: `fresh → ce_tapped → filled`.
- **Inversion FVG** — bearish FVG violated bullishly (or vice versa) — flipped polarity. The engine emits `kind=ifvg`, `state=inverted`.
- **Killzone** — institutional flow window (London Open, NY AM, NY PM).
- **CE** — Consequent Encroachment, FVG midpoint. The engine emits it as `ce`.
- **Displacement** — wide-range directional move creating an FVG. The engine scores it per FVG as `disp_score` (0–1).
- **Sweep / liquidity raid** — wick beyond a swing/level reversing. The engine emits explicit `sweep` events with a `rejected` flag.
- **MSS / BOS** — Market Structure Shift (counter-trend break) / Break of Structure (continuation). The engine emits both as `structure_events` with `event`, `dir`, `validation`.
- **Draw on Liquidity** — the major pool price is being pulled toward.

<examples>

Use these as the SHAPE for `entry hunt → confirmed` output. Each example walks the six grade elements and the per-model components in order.

<example name="A+ MSS bullish reversal at HTF sell-side run">

Pillar 1: HTF bullish (4H bullish FVG that swept a prior weekly low); buy-side draw above.
Overnight: London raided Asia Low + PDL in one push.
NY reaction: after the sweep, a strong 5m bullish displacement candle tore higher, broke above the last 5m lower high, leaving a clean 5m bullish FVG.
Pillar 2: good — wide-range displacement, no chop.

MSS components:
1. Context & Draw — HTF bullish, downside draw completed. ✓
2. Liquidity Grab — Asia low + PDL taken. ✓
3. MSS with Displacement — sharp reverse, break of last 5m lower high, fresh bullish FVG. ✓
4. Retrace to FVG — price retraced into the 5m FVG without new low. ✓
5. Confirmation — 1m full-body bullish close back above FVG CE. ✓
6. Risk & Target — stop below MSS low; TP1 last internal high, TP2 London high. ✓

Six elements: HTF bias ✓, Overnight ✓, NY reaction ✓, Pillar 2 ✓, Entry-model components ✓ (6/6), Confirmation close ✓.
Grade: **A+**

</example>

<example name="A+ Trend continuation in established uptrend">

Pillar 1: HTF Daily/4H sustained up-move respecting prior 4H bullish FVGs. London made new highs and left two 5m bullish FVGs. NY opens above them.
NY reaction: 5m rallies, leaves fresh 5m bullish FVG, retraces into it with orderly red candles.
Pillar 2: good — clean pullback, structure intact (HH/HL).

Trend components:
1. Context & HTF Bias — primary trend up; HTF FVGs respected. ✓
2. Strong Impulse Leg — wide-range up move, fresh 5m FVG. ✓
3. Pullback into Internal FVG — orderly retrace, structure intact. ✓
4. Confirmation — 1m strong bullish close above FVG CE after small bottoming wick. ✓
5. Risk & Target — stop below FVG low; TP1 pullback high, TP2 prior daily high. ✓

Six elements: HTF bias ✓, Overnight ✓, NY reaction ✓, Pillar 2 ✓, Entry-model components ✓ (5/5), Confirmation close ✓.
Grade: **A+**

</example>

<example name="A+ Bullish inversion at counter-trend FVG failure">

Pillar 1: HTF 4H bullish FVGs respected; price approaching prior weekly high.
Overnight: continued upside, no significant counter-trend.
NY reaction: strong rally; 5m prints a small bearish FVG on a micro pullback.
Pillar 2: good — large green candle rips back through with no rejection.

Inversion components:
1. Context & HTF Bias — clearly bullish; buy-side targets above. ✓
2. Opposing FVG Forms — small bearish FVG on micro pullback. ✓
3. Violation — 5m green candle closes well above the top of the bearish FVG (engine flips it to `kind=ifvg`, `state=inverted`). ✓
4. Retest & Confirmation — 1m pulls into inversion zone, prints full-body bullish candle. ✓
5. Risk & Target — stop below inversion low; TP1 intraday high, TP2 weekly high. ✓

Six elements: HTF bias ✓, Overnight ✓, NY reaction ✓, Pillar 2 ✓, Entry-model components ✓ (5/5), Confirmation close ✓.
Grade: **A+**

</example>

<example name="B-grade MSS — one weak element (Pillar 2 acceptable, not clean)">

Pillar 1: HTF bullish (4H bullish FVG below price, untaken buy-side above at PDH).
Overnight: Asia ranged, London raided Asia Low but left PDL untaken.
NY reaction: NY broke London Low on a tight wick, snapped back, broke the prior 5m lower high.
Pillar 2: acceptable — `displacement=acceptable` (2 clean bars in last 6, not 3); `candle=normal`; range adequate. Workable, weaker than A+ Pillar 2.

MSS components:
1. Context & Draw — HTF bullish, untaken buy-side above. ✓
2. Liquidity Grab — London Low taken intra-bar. ✓ (rejected sweep, failure-swing tell)
3. MSS with Displacement — break of last 5m lower high, fresh bullish FVG; `displacement=acceptable` not clean. ✓ (component present but weaker)
4. Retrace to FVG — price retraced into the 5m FVG, `state=ce_tapped`. ✓
5. Confirmation — 1m bullish close back above FVG CE, body_ratio 0.65 (strong but not max). ✓
6. Risk & Target — stop below sweep low; TP1 last internal high; TP2 PDH. ✓

Six elements: HTF bias ✓, Overnight ✓, NY reaction ✓, Pillar 2 weaker (acceptable, not clean), Entry-model components ✓ (6/6), Confirmation close ✓.
Five aligned, one weaker → **B**.

This is a tradable setup at reduced size — components all present, Pillar 2 is the single weaker element. The grade rule says B when exactly one element is weaker than A+.

</example>

<example name="no-trade — entry model components incomplete">

Pillar 1: HTF bullish (4H bullish FVG below, untaken buy-side at PDH).
Overnight: Asia and London both ranged sideways; neither extended.
NY reaction: NY opened, drifted; no clear break of overnight high or low; price chopping inside London range.
Pillar 2: marginal — `range_quality=tight`, `displacement=weak`, `candle=doji_wick`. Engine flags chop.

MSS components:
1. Context & Draw — HTF bullish. ✓
2. Liquidity Grab — missing (no sweep of any overnight low; price held inside range).
3. MSS with Displacement — missing (no `structure_events` with `event=mss + displacement=true` in current bar window).
4. Retrace to FVG — missing (no fresh FVG in the trade direction).
5. Confirmation — missing.
6. Risk & Target — n/a without entry.

Trend components:
1. Context & HTF Bias — ✓
2. Strong Impulse Leg — missing (no recent BOS, no fresh impulse FVG).
3. Pullback into Internal FVG — missing.
4. Confirmation — missing.
5. Risk & Target — n/a.

Inversion components:
1. Context & HTF Bias — ✓
2. Opposing FVG Forms — present (small bearish FVG on a micro pullback).
3. Violation — missing (no close through the bearish FVG; price respecting it).
4. Retest & Confirmation — missing.
5. Risk & Target — n/a.

Six elements: HTF bias ✓, Overnight ✗ (no untaken draw in motion), NY reaction ✗ (chop), Pillar 2 ✗ (poor), Entry-model components ✗ (no model has its core components — MSS missing 5/6, Trend missing 4/5, Inversion missing 3/5), Confirmation close ✗.
Multiple elements missing → **no-trade**.

Reason for `surface_no_trade`: "no entry model in play — chop, no liquidity sweep, no fresh impulse leg".

This is the correct way to no-trade: walk all three models, list each component, name what is missing. Do not invent reasons; do not skip the walk. The grade rule maps cleanly to the cited evidence.
